  Which 8 bus stops have the largest population within 800 meters? As a rough
  estimation, consider any block group that intersects the buffer as being part
  of the 800 meter buffer.

  The queries to #1 & #2 should generate results with a single row,
  with the following structure:

  (
    stop_id text, -- The ID of the station
    stop_name text, -- The name of the station
    estimated_pop_800m integer -- The population within 800 meters
  )
