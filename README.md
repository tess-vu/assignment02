## Instructions

Write a query to answer each of the questions below.
* Your queries should produce results in the format specified by each question.
* Write your query in a SQL file corresponding to the question number (e.g. a file named _query06.sql_ for the answer to question #6).
* Each SQL file should contain a single query that retrieves data from the database (i.e. a `SELECT` query).
* Some questions include a request for you to discuss your methods. Update this README file with your answers in the appropriate place.

### Initial database structure

There are several datasets that are prescribed for you to use in this part. Below you will find table creation DDL statements that define the initial structure of your tables. Over the course of the assignment you may end up adding columns or indexes to these initial table structures. **You should put SQL that you use to modify the schema (e.g. SQL that creates indexes or update columns) should in the _db_structure.sql_ file.**

  *   `census.population_2020` ([Census Explorer](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Populations+and+People&g=040XX00US42$1500000&y=2020&d=DEC+Redistricting+Data+(PL+94-171)&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1))  
      * In the tests, the initial table will have the following structure:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE census.population_2020 (
            geoid TEXT,
            geoname TEXT,
            total INTEGER
        );
        ```
      * Note that the file from the Census Explorer will have more fields than those three. You may have to do some data preprocessing to get the data into the correct format.

        Alternatively you can use the results from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/pl?get=NAME,GEO_ID,P1_001N&for=block%20group:*&in=state:42%20county:*), but you'll still have to transform the JSON that it gives you into a CSV.

## Questions

1.  Which **eight** bus stop have the largest population within 800 meters? As a rough estimation, consider any block group that intersects the buffer as being part of the 800 meter buffer.

```sql
with
septa_bus_stop_blockgroups as (
    select
        stops.stop_id,
        '1500000US' || bg.geoid as geoid
    from septa.bus_stops as stops
    inner join census.blockgroups_2020 as bg
        on st_dwithin(stops.geog, bg.geog, 800)
),

septa_bus_stop_surrounding_population as (
    select
        stops.stop_id,
        sum(pop.total) as estimated_pop_800m
    from septa_bus_stop_blockgroups as stops
    inner join census.population_2020 as pop using (geoid)
    group by stops.stop_id
)

select
    stops.stop_id,
    stops.stop_name,
    pop.estimated_pop_800m
from septa_bus_stop_surrounding_population as pop
inner join septa.bus_stops as stops using (stop_id)
order by pop.estimated_pop_800m desc
limit 8;
```

**Result:**

| stop_id | stop_name | estimated_pop_800m |
|---|---|---|
| 22272 | Lombard St & 18th St | 57936 |
| 25080 | Rittenhouse Sq & 18th St | 57571 |
| 24284 | Snyder Av & 9th St | 57412 |
| 22273 | Lombard St & 19th St | 57019 |
| 14958 | 19th St & Lombard St | 57019 |
| 3042 | 16th St & Locust St | 56309 |
| 25083 | Locust St & 16th St | 56309 |
| 22241 | South St & 19th St | 55789 |

2.  Which **eight** bus stops have the smallest population above 500 people _inside of Philadelphia_ within 800 meters of the stop (Philadelphia county block groups have a geoid prefix of `42101` -- that's `42` for the state of PA, and `101` for Philadelphia county)?

    **The queries to #1 & #2 should generate results with a single row, with the following structure:**

    ```sql
    (
        stop_id text, -- The ID of the station
        stop_name text, -- The name of the station
        estimated_pop_800m integer -- The population within 800 meters
    )
    ```

```sql
with
septa_bus_stop_blockgroups as (
    -- Find Philadelphia county block groups within 800 meters for each
    -- bus stop.
    select
        stops.stop_id,
        -- Match format used in population_2020 by prepending.
        '1500000US' || bg.geoid as geoid
    from septa.bus_stops as stops
    inner join census.blockgroups_2020 as bg
        on
            -- Keep block groups whose boundary falls within 800 meters 
            -- of stop.
            st_dwithin(stops.geog::geography, bg.geog::geography, 800)
    -- Restrict to Philadelphia county block groups only.
    where bg.geoid like '42101%'
),

septa_bus_stop_surrounding_population as (
    -- Sum population of all nearby block groups for each bus stop.
    select
        stops.stop_id,
        sum(pop.total) as estimated_pop_800m
    from septa_bus_stop_blockgroups as stops
    inner join census.population_2020 as pop using (geoid)
    group by stops.stop_id
    -- Keep stops w/ surrounding population beyond 500 people.
    having sum(pop.total) > 500
)

-- Join population estimates back to bus stop details for the final output.
select
    stops.stop_id,
    stops.stop_name,
    pop.estimated_pop_800m
from septa_bus_stop_surrounding_population as pop
inner join septa.bus_stops as stops using (stop_id)
-- Sort ascending so least-served stops first.
order by pop.estimated_pop_800m
-- Return only 8 stops w/ smallest surrounding population.
limit 8;
```

**Result:**

| stop_id | stop_name | estimated_pop_800m |
|---|---|---|
| 31500 | Delaware Av & Venango St | 593 |
| 30840 | Delaware Av & Tioga St | 593 |
| 31499 | Delaware Av & Castor Av | 593 |
| 31788 | Northwestern Av & Stenton Av | 655 |
| 31752 | Stenton Av & Northwestern Av | 655 |
| 27000 | Bethlehem Pk & Chesney Ln | 655 |
| 27152 | Bethlehem Pk & Chesney Ln | 655 |
| 30839 | Delaware Av & Wheatsheaf Ln | 684 |

3.  Using the Philadelphia Water Department Stormwater Billing Parcels dataset, pair each parcel with its closest bus stop. The final result should give the parcel address, bus stop name, and distance apart in meters, rounded to two decimals. Order by distance (largest on top).

    _Your query should run in under two minutes._

    >_**HINT**: This is a [nearest neighbor](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/knn.html) problem.

    **Structure:**
    ```sql
    (
        parcel_address text,  -- The address of the parcel
        stop_name text,  -- The name of the bus stop
        distance numeric  -- The distance apart in meters, rounded to two decimals
    )
    ```

```sql
select
    pwd_parcels.address as parcel_address,
    nearest.stop_name,
    nearest.distance
from phl.pwd_parcels
cross join
    lateral (
        -- Run subquery per parcel to find single closest bus stop.
        select
            septa.bus_stops.stop_name,
            -- Calculate actual geodesic distance in meters between parcel and bus stop,
            -- rounded to 2 decimal places.
            round(st_distance(phl.pwd_parcels.geog, septa.bus_stops.geog)::numeric, 2) as distance
        from septa.bus_stops
        -- Use <-> operator to pre-sort bus stops by approximate distance from current parcel
        -- using spatial index.
        order by phl.pwd_parcels.geog <-> septa.bus_stops.geog
        -- Keep only closest bus stop row.
        limit 1
    ) as nearest
-- Sort all parcels from farthest to nearest bus stop.
order by nearest.distance desc;
```

**Result:**

Ascending Version:

| parcel_address | stop_name | distance |
|---|---|---|
| 170 SPRING LN | Ridge Av & Ivins Rd | 1658.70 |
| 150 SPRING LN | Ridge Av & Ivins Rd | 1620.24 |

4.  Using the `bus_shapes`, `bus_routes`, and `bus_trips` tables from GTFS bus feed, find the **two** routes with the longest trips.

    _Your query should run in under two minutes._

    >_**HINT**: The `ST_MakeLine` function is useful here. You can see an example of how you could use it at [this MobilityData walkthrough](https://docs.mobilitydb.com/MobilityDB-workshop/master/ch04.html#:~:text=INSERT%20INTO%20shape_geoms) on using GTFS data. If you find other good examples, please share them in Slack._

    >_**HINT**: Use the query planner (`EXPLAIN`) to see if there might be opportunities to speed up your query with indexes. For reference, I got this query to run in about 15 seconds._

    >_**HINT**: The `row_number` window function could also be useful here. You can read more about window functions [in the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/tutorial-window.html). That documentation page uses the `rank` function, which is very similar to `row_number`. For more info about window functions you can check out:_

Prompt: """Don't give me answer. I'm having duplication issues and
a single-row issue when I use distinct. Is there something
wrong in my logic or conceptual understanding of how I'm
tackling this question?

Original, no distinct clause:
"130"    "Bucks County Community College"    46505
"130"    "Bucks County Community College"    46505

Distinct clause added:

(Resolved by creating unique trips w/ distinct on shape_id
before ranking to prevent duplicates.)

5.  Rate neighborhoods by their bus stop accessibility for wheelchairs. Use OpenDataPhilly's neighborhood dataset along with an appropriate dataset from the Septa GTFS bus feed. Use the [GTFS documentation](https://gtfs.org/reference/static/) for help. Use some creativity in the metric you devise in rating neighborhoods.

    _NOTE: There is no automated test for this question, as there's no one right answer. With urban data analysis, this is frequently the case._

    Discuss your accessibility metric and how you arrived at it below:

    **Description:** For each neighborhood, the query finds all wheelchair-accessible
  bus stops where wheelchair_boarding = 1, then counts the total number of
  pedestrian ramps within 150 meters of any of those stops based on rough
  average block measurements in Google Maps. Neighborhoods with more nearby
  ramps near accessible stops are considered more accessible. This has its
  limitations as it doesn't account for the quality of the ramps, the side of
  the street the ramps are on,or the actual routes of the bus stops, but it
  provides a starting point for assessing accessibility based on proximity
  to pedestrian infrastructure.

8.  With a query, find out how many census block groups Penn's main campus fully contains. Discuss which dataset you chose for defining Penn's campus.

    **Structure (should be a single value):**
    ```sql
    (
        count_block_groups integer
    )
    ```

    **Discussion:** I chose to use the PWD parcels dataset to define Penn's main
  campus and filtered the parcels to include only those owned by entities
  that are likely associated with Penn, such as "TRS UNIV OF PENN", "TRUSTEES",
  "UNIVERSITY", and "U OF P" when I was looking at their interactive map. I
  also excluded parcels that are likely associated with other universities,
  such as "DREXEL" and "TEMPLE". By using the st_contains function, I was
  able to determine which census block groups are fully contained within the
  geographic boundaries of the selected parcels.

```sql
select count(bg.geoid) as count_block_groups
from
    census.blockgroups_2020 as bg
-- Join parcels to block groups where parcel geometry falls within block group.
inner join
    phl.pwd_parcels as parcels
    on st_contains(
        bg.geog::geometry,
        parcels.geog::geometry
    )
-- Filter to parcels where owner name matches UPenn ownership variations.
where (
    parcels.owner1 like 'TRS UNIV OF PENN'
    or parcels.owner1 like 'TRUSTEES'
    or parcels.owner1 like 'UNIVERSITY'
    or parcels.owner1 like 'U OF P'
)
-- Exclude other university parcels.
and parcels.owner1 not like 'DREXEL'
and parcels.owner1 not like 'TEMPLE'
```

**Result:**

| count_block_groups |
|---|
| 99 |

9. With a query involving PWD parcels and census block groups, find the `geo_id` of the block group that contains Meyerson Hall. `ST_MakePoint()` and functions like that are not allowed.

    **Structure (should be a single value):**
    ```sql
    (
        geo_id text
    )
    ```

```sql
select bg.geoid as geo_id
from
    census.blockgroups_2020 as bg
-- Join parcels to block groups where parcel is within block group.
inner join
    phl.pwd_parcels as parcels
    on st_contains(
        bg.geog::geometry,
        parcels.geog::geometry
    )
where
    -- Address for Meyerson Hall for filtering as typed in parcel data.
    parcels.address like '220-30 S 34TH ST';
```

**Result:**

| geo_id |
|---|
| 421010369022 |

10. You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops to fill the `stop_desc` field in a GTFS feed. Using any of the data sets above, PostGIS functions (e.g., `ST_Distance`, `ST_Azimuth`, etc.), and PostgreSQL string functions, build a description (alias as `stop_desc`) for each stop. Feel free to supplement with other datasets (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), and other methods of describing the relationships. SQL's `CASE` statements may be helpful for some operations.

    **Structure:**
    ```sql
    (
        stop_id integer,
        stop_name text,
        stop_desc text,
        stop_lon double precision,
        stop_lat double precision
    )
    ```

   As an example, your `stop_desc` for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE of 1234 Market St" (that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)

   >**Tip when experimenting:** Use subqueries to limit your query to just a few rows to keep query times faster. Once your query is giving you answers you want, scale it up. E.g., instead of `FROM tablename`, use `FROM (SELECT * FROM tablename limit 10) as t`.

```sql
with liberty_bell as (
    -- Liberty Bell coordinates as ref point.
    select st_setsrid(
        st_makepoint(-75.15031592068193, 39.949548328739006),
